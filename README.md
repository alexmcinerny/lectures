<h1>Lectures Portfolio</h1>

Having done some talks in the past, and wanting to do some more in the future, I thought I'd make a list of those I've already completed, adding slides/scripts where possible. 

<h2>The list</h2>
<ul>
<li>Random walks and markov chains. [here](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/lectures/blob/main/random_walks_presentation_handout.pdf)
<li>Quantum Field Theory: What is a particle?
<li>Schrodingers equation: How can you have a matter wave without a wave equation?
<li>The Plank Length: Two electrons and how to make a black hole.
<li>How do USBs store data, and how can they pose a danger to society?
