<h1>Lectures Portfolio</h1>

Having done some talks in the past, and wanting to do some more in the future, I thought I'd make a list of those I've already completed, adding slides/scripts where possible. 

<h2>The list</h2>
<ul>
<li>- Random walks and markov chains <\li>
- Quantum Field Theory: What is a particle?
- Schrodingers equation: How can you have a matter wave without a wave equation?
- The Plank Length: Two electrons and how to make a black hole.
- How do USBs store data, and how can they pose a danger to society?
<\ul>
