<h1>Lectures Portfolio</h1>

Having done some talks in the past, and wanting to do some more in the future, I thought I'd make a list of those I've already completed, adding slides/scripts where possible. 

## Talks completed at univesrity:
- **Random walks and markov chains.** (Febuary 2024)
  - I researched the simple symetric random walk, and why for an infinite runtime, in 2 dimensions it's garenteed to pass through the origin an infinite number times (recurrent) whereas in 3 dimensions the walk has a chance to not pass through the starting point once (transient). I proved it mathematically, then tried to gauge intutiton as to why the result made sense.
  - See [slides](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/lectures/blob/main/random_walks_presentation_handout.pdf), and a very rough [script](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/lectures/blob/main/random_walks_script.pdf) (it's also a somewhat unfinished script--I used it as a guidline for the technical stuff, and then perfected the script in my head by practice!).


## Talks done during school
(These talks are, admitidly, a little less professional/rigorous/_truthful_--they're targetted to an audience of A-level students, not undergraduate physicsts!)
- **Quantum Field Theory: What is a particle?** (September 2021)
  - A (very) hand wavy start to particle physics, which didn't really envolve any QFT, but did envolve a lot of important techniques which I came to learn in 1st year of univesrity, so was definitly worth it!
  - [Slides](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/lectures/blob/main/QFT%20What%20is%20a%20Particle%20Sci%20Soc%20Handout%20-%20Alex%20McInerny%20-%200521.pdf) are there, and also [here's](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/lectures/blob/main/Article%20on%20QFT%20for%20science%20journal%20-%20Alex%20McInerny%20-%200921.pdf) an article I wrote for my school's science magazine, addapted from the script.

- **The Plank Length: Two electrons and how to make a black hole.** (June 2021)
  - This was a shorter talk I presented for my schools independant research project. It discusses squeezing two electrons really close together, and what distance they'd need to be pushed to create a black hole--on the order of the Planck length! Of course, the physics envolved is quite rudimentary, but interesting nevertheless.
  - Both [slides](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/lectures/blob/main/The%20Planck%20Length%20-%20IRP%20-%20Alex%20McInerny%20-%200621.pdf) and my [script](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/lectures/blob/main/IRP%20Script%20-%20Alex%20McInerny%20-%200621.pdf) is available for this one.

- **Schrodingers equation: How can you have a matter wave without a wave equation?** (May 2021)
  - Another pretty hand wavey one--what more can you do in year 13 having never completed a rigarous lecture series in QM? The talk uses a fair bit of trial and error to 'derive' the schrodinger equation, and then solves the infinite potential well problem while trying to show some intutition as to what was happening.
  - This one I presented by writing on a whiteboard, so no slides here, but I did write an [article](https://github.com/alexmcinerny/lectures/blob/main/The%20Schrodinger%20Equation%20Article.pdf) which I addapted from a rough script. 

- **How do USBs store data, and how can they pose a danger to society?**
  - Delved into how flash memory is used to store data, an overview of FGMOS Charge trap memeory cells, advantages of multi-layer cells, and NAND vs. NOR flash memory, how all the charge traps fit together to store whole _bits_ of data, and discussed some instances where USBs have been used for malicious perpouses.
  - Coded an HID spoofer in Arduino to show that simply plugging a USB into a computer can take controll of it--my spoofer opened word and typed out a message, then opened google, went onto youtube and played a video! Quite tame, compared with what it _could_ have done, but the interactive demonstration helped convey the dangers of USBs.
